# 1.About the data:
       1.Data is in table format of english and tamil sentences.It could be downloadable at http://www.manythings.org/anki/tam-eng.zip

# 2.Step by step Implementation:
       1.Text Importing and text cleaning
       2.Encoder and Decoder Model Building
       4.Model Training
       5.Inference Stage building
       6.Translating the sample.
       
 # Idea to the code generation is received from Codepiep,Youtube Channel and from Github repository of Mr.Harshal Lamba(TCS).
